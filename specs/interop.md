# Interoperability Notes

## AdCP
AdCP orchestrates advertising workflows (agentic ad buying and activation).  
AIPP documents **AI commerce intent provenance**. They are complementary.

## RMNs
Retail Media Networks may ingest AIPP signals as upstream provenance inputs.

## C2PA
AIPP aligns with provenance principles; it is scoped to commerce intent.
