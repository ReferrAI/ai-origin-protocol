# Non-Goals (Normative)

AIPP is intentionally narrow. It is **not** a tracking system.

AIPP does **not**:
- Track users across sites or sessions
- Create, resolve, or persist identity
- Define payment, settlement, or compensation rules
- Guarantee deterministic attribution
- Replace affiliate networks, RMNs, ad platforms, or clean rooms
- Orchestrate media buying (see AdCP for workflow orchestration)
