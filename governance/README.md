# Governance (Draft)

ReferrAI aims to keep AIPP minimal, neutral, and privacy-safe.

## Working agreements
- Prefer additive, backwards-compatible changes
- Maintain a strong Non-Goals posture
- Use MUST/SHOULD/MAY language in specs
- Public discussion via issues and PRs

## Future
Potential handoff to a neutral standards body once stable.
